                <p>
                My journey into software started with an early dream of studying <strong>computer engineering</strong> 
                <span role="img" aria-label="graduation-cap"> ðŸŽ“</span>, though I ended up in aerospace due to academic placements. 
                While I appreciated the field, I knew early on it wasnâ€™t my true passion.
                </p>
                <p>
                In my second year, I started <strong>teaching myself to code</strong> 
                <span role="img" aria-label="laptop"> ðŸ’»</span>, captivated by the creative potential in web development.
                Balancing studies in aerospace and learning to code was challenging, especially with projects and exams,
                but it kept my motivation alive.
                </p>
                <p>
                After graduation, I committed fully to coding, diving deep into web development and finding fulfillment in 
                <strong> building and designing applications</strong> 
                <span role="img" aria-label="palette"> ðŸŽ¨</span>. Itâ€™s been a rewarding pivot, driven by curiosity and a desire to create.
